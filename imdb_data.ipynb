analysis. One of them was that in some cases the movie title was given as **PK(film)** and while searching no result was shown for such cases and similar thing happened for cases like **Ghajini(2008 film)** and **Baby(2015 Hindi Film)**. So, using sql and excel I edited the data a bit which can be found in the **Bollywood_Movie_Dataset_Cleaned.xlsx** which i'll be submitting with this file. Also, there were some unwanted symbols like **Gangs of Wasseypur *â€“* Part 2** which i filtered out as well. As a result i was able to find the data of *3972/4000* movies on imdb while earlier this data was limited to just
