Instead of heaving a sigh of ""good riddance"", Mahendranath keeps hoping Rajen will return. Taking advantage of the old man's hopes, Dilip hires an unemployed youth (Raza Murad), to impersonate the lost-and-now-grown-up Rajen. Mahendranath happily hands over all his property to ""Rajen"" and is promptly murdered by Prem. ""Rajen"" himself is bumped off later.Things get more complicated with new twists and thrills at every turn. Someone is sending Dilip threatening letters about Mahendranath's murder.

Most of us lose focus and give up. We are most afraid to believe in our own dreams. Those who do are the true winners. This slice of life film is set in the backdrop of our capital city- Delhi. A city that brings in thousands of North Indians in search of opportunities that was never available in their own home towns. Like-wise, six boys from different states come together to share a two BHK apartment in a middle-class colony, which they lovingly call ""Sadda Adda"". This film is their story. It is about how six bachelors, with completely different backgrounds and personalities, live together. Their apartment ""Sadda Adda"" is a complete mess with empty beer bottles, cigarette butts, unwashed clothes, mattresses tossed all over the floor etc - yet together they cook food, clean, buy groceries, pay rent, laugh, cry, fight over insignificant issues and always stand up for each other - like a family. ""Sadda Adda"" which began as a transitional accommodation to help them work towards their dreams, becomes their home. The film takes us through a journey of their camaraderie and self-belief. The interwoven stories of these 6 characters takes us through a heart warming journey of the lives of these boys. This movie is about real characters from life who have fun, who fight the wave everyday and through very light heart moments inspire us in the most modest way. The crests and troughs that shape them into the men they will become in the future - because Boys will not always be boys.::Muazzem Beg",3.569657142857143,9 years

Paranoid and panic-stricken, she finds an unexpected savior in Karan who rescues her from a group of criminals and stops her from taking her life. Slowly, Sahiba confides in Karan about her painful past and not-so-pretty future. Sahiba is the daughter of the stern and stony-faced patriach, industrialist Yagvendra Grewal who wants to see her settle down with the very suitable son of his friend, Rai Bahadur. Unwilling to get tied down too soon with a stranger, Sahiba lies to her family telling them she got married while studying in the city and is now terrified of returning to Palanpur without a husband. Karan chivalrously offers to make the trip home with her and tell her father that she was forced to lie to him to avoid an early marriage. Along the way, Sahiba falls in love with Karan but he is still starry-eyed about his model. They arrive in Palanpur and Karan soon endears himself to Sahiba's extended family that includes her father, his three younger brothers, their wives and Biji, Sahiba's doting grandmother. Only Yagvendra refuses to accept his son-in-law, who he is convinced is after Sahiba's crores. Karan, who's never had a family of his own, is easily drawn into the warmth surrounding him and life is fine till one of Sahiba's aunts mistakenly assumes that Sahiba's expecting and spreads the word around.

He manages to sway Sarang on his side, arranges for Suryakanth to be be suspended, charged with killing two innocent bystanders, and held in a cell.

Bharati Nagar is ruled by four underworld dons, each representing a different Indian community. Dinanath persuades them to live in harmony and once they settle their differences, the four dons use Dinanath's stay in Bharat Nagar to cover up their own illegal activities. Fast Forward to 15 years later, the year is 1962. Dinanath's now grown-up son Raju turns out to be the opposite of his father by being drawn into the underworld, committing crimes to earn money with his father unaware of what he does. Raju starts working for Thakur Pratap Singh, unaware that Thakur had once kidnapped his mother and sister many years earlier which caused their separation. Will Raju find out what Thakur did to his family? Will Dinanath find out his son is not what he thinks he is?

In the current situation, through reversals of fortune, the old world order has been broken and water becomes the biggest game changer. It has a domino effect on everything from social order to economics, even love and marriage. The film takes a satirical look at respect for resources, caste divides, and rural life against the backdrop of a traditional love story but all set in a realm where water is the new currency.::Anonymous",3.0567714285714285,6 years

The village infested by robbers takes too long to respond to these devotional hymes but another village, the fishery one, accepts them open heartedly and soon becomes a golden example of transformation itself. With the help of one of the swadhyayee's wife, they finally changes fate of second village as well.::Subrat Jain",2.8016571428571426,NaN

Shocked and grief-stricken, the Sesodias propose to marry Bhojraj with Meera Rathod, to which all agree, and the wedding takes place with great pomp and ceremony on one hand, while uniting the Rajputs against Akbar. After Meera re-locates to her new home, it is then Bhojraj finds out that she is in love with somebody else, and has devoted her life and soul to him. Further inquiries lead him to discover that his wife's true love is none other than Lord Krishna. Meanwhile the news of Meera's infidelity shocks the region, and the Head Priest must now decide her fate - and the only options he has in front of him - either Meera accept Bhojraj as her husband and forget about Lord Krishna - failing which she will be asked to drink a potently lethal poison which will kill her instantly.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",3.301685714285714,42 years

Vishwanath is angered at this outrage and speaks to a senior police officer, who initially offers all help to prosecute Bunty. But when the senior police officer finds out that Bunty is really Narendra Verma, the daughter of Home Minster Rameshwari, he backs off and tells Vishwanath he cannot do anything. Vishwanath then goes to the nearest police station to lodge a F.I.R. (First Information Report), however, Police Inspector Brij Bhushan refuses to write it. When the Governor refuses to meet with him, he telephones the State Chief Minister Chandramohan, who invites him to his house the very next day. The next at the Chief Minister's residence, he finds Rameshwari and Bunty also present there. Chandramohan asks Bunty to apologize, but Vishwanath is not satisfied as he wants Bunty to be criminally prosecuted. Then Bunty's goons take over and start terrorizing Vishwanath and his family. Frustrated, Vishwanath kills himself. His suicide case is turned over to the Central Bureau of Investigation and assigned to Officers Pradhan and Abhimanyu Singh. Shortly thereafter, Bunty and Rameshwari are arrested, charged and the matter is brought to court. The court dismisses the case and Bunty & his mom are set free. Subsequently, Abhimanyu's girlfriend, Reena, gets more evidence, the case is re-opened and a warrant issued for Bunty's & his mom's arrest. It is here that the young and naive Abhimanyu will find how hard it is for justice to prevail especially when the suspect is the son of an influential Home Minister, and that politics does rule above everything else.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",2.0014285714285713,17 years

An angered Ravan mortally wounds Laxman, but Bajrangbali brings forth the Sanjeevani herb, along with the entire mountain, and Laxman gets a second life. Ten-headed Ravan is killed with Vibhisan's (Ravan's estranged brother) assistance. Ram then asks Sita to go through a Agni Parikhsha to ensure her purity, and that done they return home to Ayodhya. This is where Bajrangbali's body will be associated with Vermilion (Sindoor); Sita will find that his appetite is insatiable, and that Ram cannot stay away from him too long. Tragic events will propel Ram to expel a pregnant Sitaji from his kingdom forcing her to live in Sage Valmiki's Ashram where she will give birth to twins, Luv and Kush. Watch what happens when years later circumstances compel Ram to take up arms against his devotee Bajrangbali himself.",3.8514142857142857,45 years

The family move into a palatial mansion, Manohar quits his job, and Gokulchand closes down his shop. Shortly thereafter Gokulchand announces that he wants to go to Kashmir for a holiday. Kishore is in love with Rita and would like to get married to her. The family know that Gokulchand will never approve of this as Rita comes from a poor family and lives with her widowed aunt, so they decide to get them engaged in Gokulchand's absence. Devki borrows an expensive diamond necklace from her friend, Savitri, and, in turn, lends it to Rita. For a very long time, the family do not hear from Gokulchand, and when he returns home - they get a shock - for he has dyed his hair black, and has an Caucasian girlfriend, Dolly Little, along with her to-be son-in-law, Jerry; a son, William and daughter, Kitty. Chaos and acrimony reign when Gokulchand makes it clear that he is going to get married to Dolly, as well as the subsequent theft of twenty five Thousand Rupees, which Gokulchand suspects was both stolen by Kishore. Things get even more complicated when the family are asked to leave, and while re-locating to a shanty hut, they find the necklace missing. The questions remain what will be the outcome of Gokulchand's marriage; that of his estranged family; and how they will repay the cost of the missing necklace?::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",3.3007142857142857,NaN

Dr. Gautamdas (Rajendra Kumar) is a UK trained doctor who volunteers to go to Japan to help deal with the horror of the radiation aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They meet in Japan and the inevitable happens when hero meets heroine. Lord Bertrand Russell in London, gives Gautam his blessings and best wishes for his travel to Japan. Russell , a pacifist and anti-war thinker (who appears in a cameo role) sets the tone of this 1967 film. On arrival in Japan Dr Gautamdas takes up a role in a hospital where Meloda's father Dr Akhira (Chetan Anand) is director. The storyline takes us through the stark and sometimes gory suffering that radiation victims endured; as a stark reminder of the long term damage caused by atomic weapons. A majority of the shoot sequences are in Japan, with director Mohan Kumar taking artistic liberties in switching from the Ginza strip, with pan shots of the Mitsubishi tower, the Hokkaido and with glimpses of Mt. Fuji. A scenic gondola ride, ski fields are all part of the package. Lata Mangeshkar's rendering of the fusion song ""aisuru"" is set to a musical score that is drawn from both cultures Shankar. Mohammed Rafi sings a few forgettable, but apt to the storyline songs. A group of fishermen are exposed to radiation from French nuclear tests in the Pacific, Dr Gautamdas mounts a daring rescue to help save the fishermen. Battling angry elements Dr Gautamdas helps the fishermen survive, saving every last one of them - but at what cost? When viewed in the context of India-Japan relationship, beginning with the arrival of Buddism in Japan, formation of the Indo-Japan Society in 1905, Japan's support for Subash Chandra Bose's INA this film takes on a meaning beyond a love story. It is a cry against the horrors of atomic weapons, the enduring damage they inflict and martyrdom for a cause.::mg-gopalan",3.2506714285714287,NaN
